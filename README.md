## How to Re-Deploy
This code can be customized to visualize another data set.
####Data Prepatation
The budget data can be in various forms (csv, google doc, google fusion table), but must adhere to a fixed format in order for the app to process it properly. Budget column headers include: Fund ID, Fund, Results Area, Department ID, Department, Short Title, Link to Website, Department Description, and Control Officer. Values for appropriations and expenditures must be broken down into a separate column for each year.

See examples of prepped data:

####Configuration
1. Once the data is prepared, set dataSource in js/app.js to link up to your data.
  
  *If your budget data is in CSV form:*
  Drop the csv file in the data folder, and set dataSource to the file path.
  
  *If your data is in a google doc:*
  You will first need to publish the google doc to the web as a CSV. Then, set dataSource to the URL provided.
